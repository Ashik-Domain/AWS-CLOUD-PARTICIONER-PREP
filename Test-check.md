## 🎯 My Exam Experience

> **Note:** In accordance with AWS exam policies and NDA, I cannot share specific exam questions or content. The following reflects my general preparation experience only.

### Preparation Timeline
- **Total Preparation Time:** ~1 year of learning AWS concepts

2. **Structured Note-Taking**
   - Created module-wise notes (Modules 1-13)
   - Organized exam domain summaries

3. **Final Week Strategy**

- ✅ Read each question carefully - keywords matter
- ✅ Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- ✅ Use the flag feature for questions you want to review
